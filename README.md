# utilsFFI
Work in progress package to import data tables from a local instance of a FFI (FEAT/FIREMON Integrated) database in SQL Server Management Studio. Eventually, FFI server access will be enabled, so that the user can download data tables from the live FFI database, rather than a restored .bak of the FFI database.
